# kata-rust
Daily kata done in rust, till I get fluent in this language!

## Project structure
Rust is a language with full of features, standard library, third-party libraries and variety of tools.
Therefore, it's preferred to have different projects that each resides in its own directory.

### This is the top-level structure:

### 1. Rust language features
TODO add docs here!

### 2. Miscellaneous samples written in Rust
TODO add docs here!

### 3. General documents
TODO add docs here!

> Note: this project is for educational goals and is still in the very beginning.
> I put more and more examples here and update documents accordingly.
