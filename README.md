Daily kata done in rust, till I get fluent in this language!

## Project structure
Rust is a language full of features, standard library, third-party libraries and variety of tools.
Therefore, it's preferred to have different projects that each resides in its own directory.

Following is a list of these projects:

### rust-lang
### project-management
### serde-json
