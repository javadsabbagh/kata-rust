# Get started quickly

The purpose of this chapter is to get started quickly (Quickstart) and establish a preliminary impression of the Rust language.
In the previous chapters, we have installed Rust and configured the editor. I believe you must be eager to try it.
Note: Some concepts in this chapter only need a general understanding, and subsequent chapters will explain in detail, but please be sure to type and run the examples in this chapter yourself.

Next, let's start writing Rust programs by hand!

ps: The original chapter of this chapter was written by ee0703. Because the content is not satisfactory, [Naupio (N cat)](https://github.com/Naupio) rewrote the entire chapter and added a lot of content. Special thanks to [rust-notes](https://github.com/photino/rust-notes) from [photino](https://github.com/photino). This chapter is also heavily edited from the quickstart chapter of the new Rust book that [Naupio (N cat)](https://github.com/Naupio) is working on.
