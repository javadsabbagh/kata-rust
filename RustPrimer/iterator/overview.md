# iterator

In Rust, iterators are divided into three parts: iterators, adapters, and consumers.

Among them, the iterator itself provides an inert sequence, and the adapter performs operations such as screening, splicing, conversion and search on this sequence, and the consumer generates the final value set based on the first two.

However, it is meaningless to look at these three in isolation, so this chapter will link and write the three in one big section.
