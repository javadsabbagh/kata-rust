# FFI


FFI ([Foreign Function Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface)) is an interface used to interact with other languages. It is called language bindings in some languages, and it is generally used in Java. It is called JNI (Java Native Interface) or JNA (Java Native Access). Since many programs are written in different programming languages in reality, cross-language calls are bound to be involved. For example, if a function written in language A wants to be called in language B, there are generally two solutions: one is to make the function into a service through inter-process communication ([IPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication)) or network protocol communication ([RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki /Remote_procedure_call), [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), etc.); the other is to call directly through FFI. The former requires at least two independent processes to be realized, while the latter directly embeds the interfaces of other languages into this language, so the call efficiency is higher than the former.

Most of the current system programming field is occupied by C/C++, and Rust is positioned as a system programming language, and it is indispensable to interact with existing C/C++ code. In addition, in order to call those "slow" scripting languages, Rust must have a perfect FFI In this chapter, we will talk about Rust's FFI system.
