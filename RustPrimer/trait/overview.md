# traits and trait objects

**trait** (feature) is similar to **interface** or **protocol** in other languages, specifying a set of functions that must be satisfied by an actual type
The difference from interface is that interface will hide the concrete implementation type, but trait will not. In rust, the hidden implementation type can be made by generic and trait.

Traits in **Rust**:

* [trait keyword](trait.md)
* [trait object](trait-object.md)
