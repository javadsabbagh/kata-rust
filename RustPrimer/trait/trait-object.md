# trait object (trait object)

A trait object in **Rust** refers to a trait encapsulated by a pointer, such as `&SomeTrait` and `Box<SomeTrait>`.

```rust
trait Foo { fn method(&self) -> String; }

impl Foo for u8 { fn method(&self) -> String { format!("u8: {}", *self) } }
impl Foo for String { fn method(&self) -> String { format!("string: {}", *self) } }

fn do_something(x: &Foo) {
    x.method();
}

fn main() {
    let x = "Hello".to_string();
    do_something(&x);
    let y = 8u8;
    do_something(&y);
}
```

`x: &Foo` where `x` is a trait object, the pointer is used here because `x` can be any type instance that implements `Foo`, the memory size is not determined, but the size of the pointer is fixed.

## Implementation of trait object

The `&SomeTrait` type is different from the normal pointer type `&i32`. It includes not only pointers to real objects, but also a pointer to a virtual function table. Its internal implementation is defined in the `std::raw` module:

```rust
pub struct TraitObject {
    pub data: *mut (),
    pub vtable: *mut (),
}
```

Where `data` is a pointer to an instance of the actual type, and `vtable` is a virtual function table pointing to the actual type's implementation of the trait:

The vtable type of `Foo`:

```rust
struct FooVtable {
    destructor: fn(*mut ()),
    size: usize,
    align: usize,
    method: fn(*const ()) -> String,
}
```

The previous code can be read as:

```rust
//u8:
// This function will only be called with a pointer to u8
fn call_method_on_u8(x: *const ()) -> String {
    let byte: &u8 = unsafe { &*(x as *const u8) };

    byte.method()
}

static Foo_for_u8_vtable: FooVtable = FooVtable {
    destructor: /* compiler magic */,
    size: 1,
    align: 1,

    method: call_method_on_u8 as fn(*const ()) -> String,
};


// String:
// This function will only be called with a pointer to String
fn call_method_on_String(x: *const ()) -> String {
    let string: &String = unsafe { &*(x as *const String) };

    string.method()
}

static Foo_for_String_vtable: FooVtable = FooVtable {
    destructor: /* compiler magic */,
    size: 24,
    align: 8,

    method: call_method_on_String as fn(*const ()) -> String,
};


let a: String = "foo".to_string();
let x: u8 = 1;

// let b: &Foo = &a;
let b = TraitObject {
     // data stores a reference to the actual value
     data: &a,
     // vtable stores the actual type to implement the method of Foo
     vtable: &Foo_for_String_vtable
};

// let y: &Foo = x;
let y = TraitObject {
    data: &x,
    vtable: &Foo_for_u8_vtable
};

// b.method();
(b.vtable.method)(b.data);

// y.method();
(y.vtable.method)(y.data);
```

## Object Security

Not all traits can be used as trait objects, such as:

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
let o = &v as &Clone;
```

There will be an error:

```
error: cannot convert to a trait object because trait `core::clone::Clone` is not object-safe [E0038]
let o = &v as &Clone;
        ^~
note: the trait cannot require that `Self : Sized`
let o = &v as &Clone;
        ^~
```
Let me analyze the cause of the error:

```rust
pub trait Clone: Sized {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self;

    fn clone_from(&mut self, source: &Self) { ... }
}
```

Although `Clone` itself inherits the `Sized` trait, its methods `fn clone(&self) -> Self` and `fn clone_from(&mut self, source: &Self) { ... }` contain `Self` type , and **Rust** is dynamically dispatched when using the trait object method, we donâ€™t know the actual type of the trait object at all, it can be any value of any type that implements the trait, so `Self` is here The size of is not `Self: Sized`, this situation is called `object-unsafe` or `not object-safe` in **Rust**, such a trait cannot be a trait object.

Summarize:

If a `trait` method is `object safe`, it needs to satisfy:

* method has a `Self: Sized` constraint, or
* All of the following conditions are met at the same time:
  * no generic parameters
  * is not a static function
  * Other parameters and return values except `self` cannot use `Self` type

If a `trait` is `object-safe`, it needs to satisfy:

* All methods are `object-safe`, and
* trait does not require the `Self: Sized` constraint
