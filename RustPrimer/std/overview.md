# Standard library example

Well, the book is almost finished here. I believe that after you have learned so much content, you must be eager to try it, right?
Below, we will focus on the code and explain a few examples using the `std` library, that is, the standard library. I hope you can learn a little bit of writing from it and start your own Rust journey.

* Note: Since the author's computer is openSUSE Linux, all the codes in this chapter are only compiled under `openSUSE Leap 42.1 && rustc 1.9.0-nightly (52e0bda64 2016-03-05)`, and the adaptation to Linux may be more It's better, students of other systems please refer to it by yourself.

Another: This chapter was originally designed with time API processing attached, but when this chapter was written, most of Rust's time API was still in an Unstable state and may be deleted or rewritten at any time. Therefore, we have temporarily removed the operation of the time API. Wait until the API of Rust is stable in the future, and then complete this section.

1. [System command: call grep](process.md)
2. [Directory operation: simple grep](fs-and-path.md)
3. [Network module: W Echo](net.md)
